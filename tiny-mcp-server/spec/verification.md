# Verification

## 1. Unit Testing

Every use case must have unit tests before it is considered implemented. See `architecture.md` § Testing for tool setup and which test type to use per view type.

### Coverage Requirements

- Each acceptance criterion should be covered by at least one test
- Business rules must have dedicated tests (especially edge cases like limits, validation, and error handling)
- Tests must pass (`./gradlew test`) before the use case status is set to **Implemented**

### Naming Conventions

- **Test class**: `[FeatureName]Test.java`
- **Test methods**: descriptive names that map to acceptance criteria or business rules (e.g., `onlyItemsWithFutureEventsAreDisplayed`, `maximumSixItemsPerTransaction`)
- **Structure**: one test class per use case, with individual test methods for each acceptance criterion and business rule edge case
